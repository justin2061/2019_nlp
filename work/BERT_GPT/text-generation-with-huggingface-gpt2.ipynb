This reduces the chances of us getting weird words (low probability words) while allowing for a dynamic selection size. We need only top a value for both `top_k` and `top_p`. We can even include the inital temperature parameter if we want to, Let's now see how our model performs now after adding everything together. We will check the top 5 return to see how diverse our answers are:**"
