    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    ".. Note:: Feel free to skip these review sections if you're already familiar with the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with the `bag-of-words model\n",
    "<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model>`_ from the\n",
    "`core_concepts_vector` section.\n",
    "This model transforms each document to a fixed-length vector of integers.\n",
    "For example, given the sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.``\n",
    "- ``John also likes to watch football games. Mary hates football.``\n",
    "\n",
    "The model outputs the vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]``\n",
    "- ``[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1]``\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vector has 10 elements, where each element counts the number of times a\n",
    "particular word occurred in the document.\n",
    "The order of elements is arbitrary.\n",
    "In the example above, the order of the elements corresponds to the words:\n",
    "``[\"John\", \"likes\", \"to\", \"watch\", \"movies\", \"Mary\", \"too\", \"also\", \"football\", \"games\", \"hates\"]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bag-of-words models are surprisingly effective, but have several weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, they lose all information about word order: \"John likes Mary\" and\n",
    "\"Mary likes John\" correspond to identical vectors. There is a solution: bag\n",
    "of `n-grams <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram>`__\n",
    "models consider word phrases of length n to represent documents as\n",
    "fixed-length vectors to capture local word order but suffer from data\n",
    "sparsity and high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the model does not attempt to learn the meaning of the underlying\n",
    "words, and as a consequence, the distance between vectors doesn't always\n",
    "reflect the difference in meaning.  The ``Word2Vec`` model addresses this\n",
    "second problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing: the ``Word2Vec`` Model\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "``Word2Vec`` is a more recent model that embeds words in a lower-dimensional\n",
    "vector space using a shallow neural network. The result is a set of\n",
    "word-vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar\n",
    "meanings based on context, and word-vectors distant to each other have\n",
    "differing meanings. For example, ``strong`` and ``powerful`` would be close\n",
    "together and ``strong`` and ``Paris`` would be relatively far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The are two versions of this model and :py:class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec`\n",
    "class implements them both:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skip-grams (SG)\n",
    "2. Continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW)\n",
    "\n",
    ".. Important::\n",
    "  Don't let the implementation details below scare you.\n",
    "  They're advanced material: if it's too much, then move on to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Word2Vec Skip-gram <http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model>`__\n",
    "model, for example, takes in pairs (word1, word2) generated by moving a\n",
    "window across text data, and trains a 1-hidden-layer neural network based on\n",
    "the synthetic task of given an input word, giving us a predicted probability\n",
    "distribution of nearby words to the input. A virtual `one-hot\n",
    "<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot>`__ encoding of words\n",
    "goes through a 'projection layer' to the hidden layer; these projection\n",
    "weights are later interpreted as the word embeddings. So if the hidden layer\n",
    "has 300 neurons, this network will give us 300-dimensional word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous-bag-of-words Word2vec is very similar to the skip-gram model. It\n",
    "is also a 1-hidden-layer neural network. The synthetic training task now uses\n",
    "the average of multiple input context words, rather than a single word as in\n",
    "skip-gram, to predict the center word. Again, the projection weights that\n",
